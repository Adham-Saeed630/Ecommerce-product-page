# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is my solution to the
[E-commerce product page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6)
on Frontend Mentor. The project focuses on building a responsive and interactive e-commerce product page using React and Redux.
